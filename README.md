# Enhancing-Stroke-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

Do you know? According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 📊  stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths. 🚀

This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get a stroke based on input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relevant information about the patient. I will follow all the machine learning pipelines in this research, including Data Preprocessing, Feature Selection using statistical tests, and Model selection using random forest, to check which models fit perfectly with the data. Although the data is small, we will get an idea about the proper Machine Learning Healthcare project.

**Data Source:** 📊 
The dataset [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) is publicly available on Kaggle.


## Methodology:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and encoded the dataset.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Conducted T-tests, Mann-Whitney U tests, and Chi-square tests for feature selection.
3. **Model Selection**: Implemented SVM, Random Forest, and KNN algorithms.

## 🏆 Best Model:
RandomForest

## 📈 Performance Metrics:
|----------------------------|
| Metric           | Value   |
|------------------|---------|
| **Accuracy**     | 94%     |
| **F1 Score**     | 0.97    |
|----------------------------|


## Conclusion:
In this predictive analysis of the Stroke Prediction Dataset, I have implemented various key areas, such as feature selection via statistical tests, the Random Forest Classifier Machine Learning Model, and further performance assessment through good and reliable performance metrics. The high degree of correlation of all the selected characteristics with stroke indicates that risks are not unique but are multiple. Although the Random Forest model is impressive, including high ROC-AUC, there is an opportunity to increase the overall recall not to miss critical cases. Future work may be done to employ methods like class balancing, more hyperparameter optimization, or other algorithms to improve model results.
